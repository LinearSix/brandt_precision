## 
1. You want to add an entry to the portfolio page, the Celazole PBI Fangs (I’m trying to remember what these are)
Do I already have photos of this or are they forthcoming?

2. You want to add an entry to the portfolio page, a stainless burner tip.
Again, are there photos of this already?

3. You want to add an entry to the portfolio page, the MMarks 810 Bronze bread grinder center and main part.
It sounds like we still need a photo of this.

4. You want to add an entry to the portfolio page, a gold plated Berylium Copper thumb nut.
It sounds like we still need a photo of this.

5. You want the Berylium Copper part description to lead into some text about additional services such as paint, powder coating, 
electro-polish or any plating or secondary process called for, including having things cleaned and packaged for clean room use.
(Here, an idea might be to have some of the text in the Berylium Copper description link to a section in the “services” page that outlines these services.)

6. Add these materials to the exotic materials list: Boron Nitride, Tungsten, Ceramic, Be Cu, Nickel 200, Glass-filled Teflon, PEEK, and Glass filled PEEK, 
Monel, Bronzes, Heavy Metal (what is that?), and Tungsten impregnated graphite.

7. I’m not sure what that spot is on the graphite photo. Jeff was probably eating chips next to it.
I can tinker with it a bit, but I don’t have Photoshop or any advanced photo tools. I’ll see what I can pull off. 

8. You want to add some text to the Clients section of the “About” page describing reliable on time job completion being a reason clients choose Brandt. 

9. You want to add to the list of industries on the “About” page: Firearm prototyping and custom work, Pharmaceutical,  Defense, oil field, oil exploration, 
Agriculture, Music and recording industry, movie industry, Automotive, and racing.

You mention BAE (I had to look that up). Do you want to mention that company specifically next to Defense?

10. Possibly mention high-speed machining in the production header of the “Services” section

11. I will investigate what option we have with the map. It is essentially being imported from google, which is how it has actual direction functionality. 
I don’t actually construct it, I just display it. They do have some options, but I think they’re fairly simple things like the size of the map. 
Again. I’ll see what options they offer, but it may be limited.
